            "I'm actually a student at UOL, although currently on a year out. First I've heard of this. There's a system online where you can submit proposals to the guild, and it was used to get the Myanmar leader (initials ASK, don't remember her name) removed over the royhinga massacre, but it's usually worthless suggestions. Around exams there was a popular suggestion to get a room of puppies to destress, and there was a popular proposal to ban meat on mondays to promote veganism. Those \"popular\" suggestions had around 100 votes up out of a student body of 20k. I can guarantee that the vast majority of the student body does not give a fuck.",
            "I was also a student at University of Liverpool a couple of years ago. I can confirm that most students weren't interested in campus politics, and that it was usually the same few dozen people who were involved in campaigns.",
            "is this not true of all student politics?",
            "My Uni (Cardiff) boasted about a 3% turnout.",
            "Jeez, I guess the 10-20% turnout for our uni-wide elections isn't so bad then. College elections within the uni tend to be much higher turnout, but when there's only 300-800 students voting, it actually makes a difference both in voting and in policy. ",
            "3% is the second highest ever. 9% is the record, very long standing too. Cardiff Uni elections are the entire university and this was for electing a bunch of officers to the Welsh and National whatever they call the big get togethers. I think most positions were one candidate standing too.",
            "I think we had ~15% for an NUS disaffiliation referendum, which was narrowly to stay in. There was a similar turnout for a referendum to do with publication of results. It would have been higher, but the SU had completely failed to properly define what the result was for. ",
            "It's probably because college unions seem much more relatable - I've tended to see my college union president on close to a daily basis since we actually know each other, as well as some others involved in the union, and I've often heard from him about (or had input on) various bits of policy. \n\nMeanwhile, the only interaction with the uni-wide union is through an email nobody reads anyway. Plus since they're not directly responsible for student welfare etc. (that's the job of college unions) the work they do is also much less relatable. However the fact that college union elections have a high turnout possibly increases turnout in uni-wide elections a little.",
            "Yep. Central union makes meaningless, waving statements; the JCRs and MCRs campaign to get better beer on tap at the college bar. I know which one makes more of a difference in my life.",

I've got a lot of problems with the left-wing especially the fucking tankie types you only ever see at university but atm it seems like this is the replacement attack line for Labour now the IRA/Muslim/Satan innuendo failed.

            "Anyone could staff 70% of the student council with hand-picked candidates with just a few well-placed bribes and promises. No one cares to do it, because the resources it grants access to are laughable. It's mainly the batshit ideological crusaders who find value in student politics. Real politics are a completely different league, with completely different motivations and players. The brainwashed crazies don't make it far there. Too inflexible to compromise and to adapt to practical necessities.",
            "The only student politician of any real note who I can think of who went into actual adult politics is Wes Streeting, and he's hardly Mr Marxist McLeftie.",
            "What are you on about? Half our MPs were heavily involved in student politics. How do you think we get our MPs in the first place? They join the Labour and Tory youth wings while still in uni, most of the time, and the political party wings in universities are usually strongly involved in student politics. ",

            "Along with a lot of important things that came about with left-wing politics in the 70s there was crazy suggestions that they used to denigrate the whole group.\n\nPeople just love to pretend a group of 5 students making a point are a worry. ",

The mandate for successful candidates was very small, and no one was really sure what the leadership team did.\n\nPretty much every year the conservative society would submit plans for a 300ft Thatcher statue and get them to quite an advanced level. It sort of just highlighted the weirdness that is student politics and how anything can be permitted so long as more than 20 people put their minds to it.",

There’s just very few ways of serving ads that aren’t obnoxious and still profitable. Anything that covers the content or scrolls with you can go and spontaneously combust as far as I’m concerned.",
            "I don't know what the different ads generate but those can certainly wither away and die.

I know adverts were getting ridiculous before Adblock but there are better ways to get websites to change their ways. \n\nIf you use Adblock that's fine but if you use Adblock *and* complain about the state of online journalism etc., you're taking a liberty. And before it gets mentioned, sure, improving the funding of journalism is not a panacea for fixing the problems within journalism. \n\nE. Some people have expressed a vehement dislike of advertising, without any nuance. For those, I would just like you to consider one question: where did you find out/learn about Adblock, through advertising or word of mouth (another form of advertising)? Also, consider all the safety and charity advertising that has been beneficial to society.  ",

            "Read the wikipedia link /u/hunnensturm posted for a quick primer.\n\nMalware has been spread across an enormous amount of otherwise large trusted sites and services like the NYT, Spotify, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, and even across Google's ad network (i.e. half the sites on the internet). It's one of the faster growing attack vectors in recent years.\n\nIf you don't run an ad blocker and disable third party domain scripts / frames by default these days, it's increasingly likely you will be (or have already been) exposed to malware. It's exactly like fucking around without a condom, sooner or later you'll get the digital clap.\n\nMany users also never even realise they've been compromised unless the payload is intentionally overt in nature, such as ransomware. Spyware, RATs / trojans, miners and botnet clients only have any benefit to the attacker when they hide their processes from the user.\n\nSure, going to warez and porn sites obviously increases the risk but there's no such thing as \"safe sites\" to stick to. The vast majority of online businesses who deploy adverts contract it out entirely to agencies who often totally fail to do any serious due diligence on the specific content they are serving up to their clients. And that's the agencies which aren't outright malicious themselves.\n\nThe only realistic solution is for more people to buy subs from outlets they want to support, I have several myself. But that's also not feasible for everyone. Just because they can't afford to do so, it doesn't mean they should expose their identities, personal data, and finances to attack.",

            "A lot of people don't care. In a way that's a problem though, because such apathy could easily result in the wholesale hollowing of our connection to the past.\n\nThere is a value in keeping things the same. It's not a monetary or ethical value so it's hard to argue for - it's just that there's something fundamentally pleasant, comforting and enriching about having a street name remain the same for hundreds of years. It's not a big value, at least not individually - no-one is experiencing ecstasy from the mere knowledge that that statue in the park has been there for ages and memorialises someone important, but if you add up all the millions of tiny bits of niceness this produces it's actually quite important, I think.\n\nSometimes there's a good reason to change a name or pull down a statue or make other changes. Actually they happen all the time. But this is a really shit reason, because naming something after someone or having a statue of them doesn't mean you approve of everything they did or believed. Not even remotely. This is such a weird misunderstanding that I find it hard to understand.\n\nBut the problem is that it's a seductive argument: so-and-so did something bad, so we shouldn't honour them. And changing this name isn't such a big deal so why not do it? \"Eh\" everybody says, \"I guess that *is* bad, and I guess it *isn't* such a big deal.

            "Loooooool.",
            "Most certainly true. They roughly break even. CBS breaks it down pretty well. On my cell or I'd link the article",
            "Alphabet is a big ass company aka Google, it has lots of capital. The owners always want products to be free or dirt cheep. Any new market they enter, prices get dropped instantly Or the public accepts it as free like gemail. \n\nDon't forget, Google is an advertisement company. The more products and services they offer, the more publicity they get, and you remember the brand more. ",
            "YouTube accounted for about 6 percent of Google's $66 billion in revenue during 2014\n\nthey say thet don't make profit but do you see all the ads,they also only pay little for content,most people put it on for free",
            "yes but revenue and profit are different youtube still apparently is not turning over any profit for google it wouldn't matter if youtube counted for 6% or 60% of revenue if it makes no profit",
            "google does not admit to profit",
            "Google's spin-off benefits from owning YouTube include the accumulation of our data and strengthening of their network design -- and the more time people spend watching online video, the more advertisers will pour into marketing on the internet as a whole. There's no doubt that Google can afford YouTube.\" \n\n McMahon also believes that by keeping quiet about YouTube's hidden benefits and by allowing the misconception of it as a deeply unprofitable business to circulate, things work very nicely in Google's favour when it comes to negotiating with copyright holders in the world of TV, movies and music. Copyright holders can't demand money that isn't there, and it would certainly take no more than a hint of profitability at YouTube for lawyers to descend, threatening court cases and demanding higher royalties. In the new, topsy-turvy world of online economics, it seems astonishing that losses on paper have actually made YouTube a more powerful online force. This leaves out another point as well: the more that people believe YouTube is unprofitable, the less likely they are to build serious competitors. I have no idea whether or not YouTube is actually profitable directly yet (I'd doubt it), but I think those who are insisting that the acquisition by Google was a bad idea, or that YouTube is somehow on its deathbed, haven't taken much time to understand some basic trendlines or the larger picture of how Google views YouTube, and the opportunities it has to make money via YouTube down the road."

Human behaviour is just so chaotic and uniformity i believe will never be achieved.",

He's posted photographs of himself using a precision flatbar and a flashlight to prove this. \n\nHow on Earth ancient peoples obtained flatness on stone finer than 2/10,000ths of an inch is certainly something that leaves me scratching my head.  The sarcophagus walls are also perfectly parallel from the ground up, which is extremely impressive given that it was carved from a single block of granite. ",

            "...yes, that is indeed the current “accepted” reasoning. I’m implying that it’s for a different, much deeper reason. How did all civilizations complete separated in space and time come to attach value to gold? Why did some civilizations mine and collect gold, without understanding its uses or potential value? Why specifically gold, and not one of the many other shiny precious metals? How did one become so universally sought after?\n\n*Hint: the answer won’t be found in a history book or on Wikipedia*",

Sweet this is way better than that black rock or the red Rock and look I can even form it into shapes I like easy and it won't break like stupid green rocks or pearl rocks!! This shiny rock is awesome! I'll call it gold!!\n\nThat same discovery happened all over the world by various tribes of men in the same organic manner except for maybe native Americans who saw no value in it.",

If so, you might want to check out r/history. They’ll even remove comments that speak of alternative theories that the historical community doesn’t approve of for you!\n\nHere at r/conspiracy though, we like to try and expand our minds by throwing out potential theories that don’t always fit the currently accepted dogma. Rather than immediately try to prove that you’re theory is “right”, why not take even a second to at least *entertain* the idea? Even just as a thought experiment. \n\nAnother question: what’s your opinion on the idea that there were once human civilizations equally, if not more advanced than our current civilization, that existed 9000+ years ago, who’s recorded history has been lost to time, and only whispers of them exist today in mythology, religious texts, cave drawings, and carvings in places like Egypt?",

Service was slow, but that was ok.\n\nAs we were leaving we found out that the pub wasn't open and it was that fellows day off. But, he never mentioned it. Just gave us friendly service.

Said if he told them we were American they woukd have sent an armed guard with us everywhere.\n\nHe said it was very safe, but when it comes to Americans they don't take chances.\n\nHe drove us all over the country that week.\n\nThe days lasted so long - he would take us everywhere and give detailed history about everything. Finally we would get tired and ask to go back to the hotel.\n\nSwelled with pride when he said that the beloved Anwar Sadat and American President Jimmy Carter were best friends. \n\nEven asked us to come to his home for dinner to meet his family.\n\nHe had an apartment on the 5th floor with a perfect view of the pyramids.\n\nThe feast he laid out defies description.

            "I can't believe people are missing the two obvious flaws in this analysis. This infographic doesn't show that 6 companies control 90% of the media. It doesn't provide any basis for the 90% figure. That's just a number pulled out of the air. All it shows is that 6 companies create and/or distribute a lot of media content. \n\nThere are other problems, too. I will update this when I get a few minutes to expand on it. \n\nEDIT: Ok, let's explore why this graphic is partly true, partly false and partly misleading. This isn't a comprehensive examination, just a look at some problems that stood out to me.\n\n&gt; *“Media has never been more consolidated. 6 media giants now control a staggering 90% of what we read, watch or listen to.”*\n\nThe most fundamental problem is here. They give the numerator (the 6 media giants and the media they create or distribute), but never give the denominator (the total amount of media Americans consume). In fact, the infographic seems to suggest that it is basically just comparing ownership of the largest media outlets in 1983 to ownership of those same outlets today....as if media consumption today is, apart from ownership, the same as it was in 1983.  \n\n*&gt; \"232 Media executives control the information diet of 277 million Americans\"*\n\nWhere do these numbers come from?  How does he arrive at 232 media executives? What constitutes \"executive\" or \"control\" or an executive with control? The infographic does not explain. These are just numbers thrown out without any context or apparent methodology. \n\n\nThe infographic says the Comcast/NBC merger guarantees \"monopoly of 11 US markets like NYC and Chicago.\" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. Comcast is not the only provider in NYC or Chicago, and NBCUniversal was not the only cable channel/content producer/network, so in what sense did the merger create a \"monopoly\" in 11 markets?  \n\n*&gt; \"In 1995, the FCC forbade companies ownership of more than 40 stations. Clear Channel Communications now owns over 1,500.\"*\n\nIn 1996, Congress updated the Communications Act and eased ownership restrictions. As a result, some companies started buying a lot of radio stations. Many of those companies are now struggling to stay afloat, because radio audiences have cratered due to the rise of things like the iPod, satellite radio and the Internet. \n\nBut, you argue, maybe radio would be doing better if it was still locally owned instead of owned by big chains. That's a valid hypothesis. Unfortunately, locally owned and operated radio stations are not doing particularly well, either. The entire industry is struggling. The ability to achieve economies of scale has helped many radio stations that would otherwise be even further underwater. This benefit, however, is balanced against the tremendous debt burden that ClearChannel and other big companies took on when buying up stations.\n\nIn any event, \"80% of stations' playlists match\" because people are mostly the same everywhere. As exotic as those yankees/southerners/west coasters/midwesterners/people from Florida may seem to us, folks in other parts of the United States really aren't *all* that different.  Well, maybe people from Florida are, but the rest of us are pretty similar. There are some differences, which is why some areas have more country/rap/alternative/jazz/classical stations than others, but people who like classic rock mostly like the same bands and songs. People who like top 40 mostly like the same bands and songs.  \n\nRadio stations do extensive audience testing to determine their playlists, to measure what songs are getting \"burned\" and what songs audiences like (or might like). There are some regional differences, but people mostly like the same things. People in radio often hear outsiders who are certain they know what the station should do differently -- more new music, more variety, whatever -- and, frankly, many radio people would prefer their stations had more variety and were more inventive. But you know what? They also realize that what people say they want and what people *actually listen to* are two pretty different things. If \"more new music/more variety\" worked consistently, radio stations would do that, because money. \n\n*&gt; \"The Big Six's box office sales hit $7 billion in 2010, that's 2X the box office sales of the next 140 Studios*\"\n\nWait, earlier the infographic were talking about how a few media giants \"control\" the media by owning everything.  But this is a different claim. This claims that the few media giants are just *more successful* than \"the next 140 studios\". If there are 146 studios, then it sounds like there's a lot of competition to produce content and people just prefer the content produced by the \"Big 6\"....or, in reality, produced by one of many, many other studios and bought by the \"Big 6\" for distribution. \n\nAnd finally, the infographic closes with this dire warning: \"Until regulations return (or they buy each other out of existence), they will continue to control 90% of everything Americans see, hear and consider important.\"\n\nSounds serious, right? Now consider what some of the \"media consolidation\" Pollyanna's [were saying 15 years ago](https://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/roundtable_docs/cooper-a.pdf). \n\n&gt; \"The Internet has not yet evolved into a ubiquitous mass communications medium that can challenge the other media.\"\n\nYeah? How are those radio stations, newspapers and magazines holding up these days? \n\n&gt; \"The increasing concentration of the Internet is stunning. AOL's dominance of subscribership in the U.S. is widely noted ... Even more striking is the growth in the concentration of usage. Because the number of potential online channels is infinite, some assume that market dominance is an impossibility on the Internet. This is faulty reasoning. ... Analysis of Media Metrix data over the past three years shows an incontrovertible trend toward online media consolidation…. Between March 1999 and March 2001, the total number of companies controlling 50 percent of user minutes online decreased by nearly two-thirds, from 11 to four. Because AOL has such a dominant position (over 30 percent of user time) the HHI is about 1200, well above the moderately concentrated threshold. The four firm concentration ratio also falls in the range where concerns about concentration and the abuse of market power begin. \n\nYes, 15 years ago they were Deeply Concerned that a few companies, mainly AOL, would \"control\" online media.  Shortly thereafter, AOL collapsed, Google and Facebook rose and every asshole with a Twitter account became their own media provider. \n\nThere are big media companies. There always have been. We'll be fine. \n\nIn the meantime, giving government more power over the media will not make things better. \n",

            "&gt;If ClearChannel divested itself of every radio station it owned AND those radio stations were bought by local owners, they would still struggle.\n\nThat's speculation on your part, and something that CAN NOT be generalized. Some markets are thriving, some are floundering. Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. Competition and diversity are what make for a healthy market place.\n\n&gt;Divestiture isn't a solution to the problems the entire radio industry faces.\n\nThat's wholly irrelevant to a discussion about consolidated media's  detrimental effects on Democracy.\n\nSolutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.",
            "&gt; That's speculation on your part\n\nIt is based on the fact that radio stations are struggling all over the country. There are obviously stations making a great deal of money, especially in large markets, but there are a lot of stations that are barely staying afloat whether they are locally or nationally owned.  In fact, many locally owned stations had to sell to the national chains many years ago because they simply didn't have the resources to compete. \n\n&gt; Let the market decide what happens to each station individually. A station that doesn't serve it's market well may serve a different market simply by changing format. \n\nYeah, that's how it works no matter who owns the radio stations. ClearChannel, Cumulus, Infinity...they will change the format in a heartbeat if they think the market will better support a different format. \n\n&gt; Solutions to the radio industry's financial problems shouldn't come at the expense of a free press and a healthy Democracy.\n\nI'm pretty skeptical that the identity of the owner of Hot 104.5 is a critical element in maintaining our democracy. Whether it is owned by ClearChannel or by the local Smith family does not make *that* big a difference in the programming of the radio station. Both of them are trying to maximize profitability and that means adopting whatever research, experts and program directors tell them is most likely to succeed. ",
            "Shareholders control it too. They can start unloading shares which forces these corporations to make changes. Also what you watch matters.\n\nFrom what I remember though the media, especially print and TV news media, have had arrangements with their 'owners' about what the owners can and can't do. I am pretty sure they can't tell them how to report the news for example. There is a level of non-interference in the contracts when stuff was sold on and usually news group had people in them who continued to work there.\n\nHaving said that, skeptics should be skeptical and I would agree with Noam Chomsky's documentary and book on the media - Manufacturing consent."

            "From wikipedia: \"Though past research showed no correlation between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and food dyes,[15][16] new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating ADD and ADHD symptoms, both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population.[17][18] Older studies were inconclusive, quite possibly due to inadequate clinical methods of measuring offending behavior. Parental reports were more accurate indicators of the presence of additives than clinical tests.[19] Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients, including artificial colors, were eliminated from school food programs.[20][21]\"\n\nThere is some scientific validity to what she is saying. Maybe she should be giving you the hard stare for automatically assuming she was wrong without doing your research first.",
            "Hah, well I'll be damned. \n\nAnd to be fair, she's known for saying some really out-there things. But hey, being proven wrong on something is always a good experience. Thanks. I'll have to look into it more. \n\nWhat's the link for that, by the way? Would I just look up food dye on wiki?",
            "Well, to be fair as well, it's Wikipedia.\n\nThe FDA sponsored a review of the extant literature about two years ago. A summary of the findings here: http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fda-panel-finds-no-link-between-artificial-food-colorings-and-hyperactivity-in-most-children-201104012184\n\nEdit: tl;dr whole article: No, food dyes conclusively do not *cause* ADHD. There is some possibility that it may exacerbate the symptoms a little.  The increase is barely noticeable even in the subgroups (explains about 10% of the variation).",
            "Red-head here. Food dyes are often used in shitty processed foods, which are also usually high in sugar. And other shit I'm allergic to, which can cause a wide variety of annoying symptoms, most of which result in fidgety behavior on my part. Feed me straight-out veggies for a week, and you'll find a much saner and more focused person in my skin. I know I don't speak for everyone, but I don't consider myself that unique either.",
            "Sure.  But now you're not talking really about *food dyes*, you're mostly talking about the difference between a shitty diet and a good one. If you stop eating foods with dyes in them, you've probably improved your diet markedly and that may have some impact, but not necessarily tied directly to the food dye itself. I'm pretty sure you could find a diet that contained not a single food dye that would result in the same symptoms.",
            "Yeah, all allergies cause symptoms, not just allergies towards red dyes. I assume this also might be a factor in all those issues resolving the factuality of dye-effects, as mentioned in that first wiki-quote.",
            "Yep. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_coloring. ",
            "Thanks for that",
            "No problem",
            "My niece has an allergy to tartrazine, which is a chemical in red dye. One of the symptoms of her reaction is extreme irritability which could probably be confused for ADHD. If your friend already has ADHD it would probably be indistinguishable from an extreme reaction.",
            "To chime in with /u/immaculate_deception\n\nCheck out the [Feingold Diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feingold_diet)\n\nThere has been some research to tie ADHD-like symptoms to a food allergy and is often tied to synthetic preservatives. However, there is some compelling evidence against the hypothesis as well: http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/feingold.html",
            "You can't reason someone out of a belief they didn't use reason to get to in the first place.",
            "Whats the reason behind your reasoning? I reason that the reason people reason like that is not the lack of reason within their reasoning, but because the reasons presented at the time seemed like a reasonable reason to reason, I reason.",
            "Sounds reasonable. ",
            "You didn't use reason to come to the conclusion that this person wasn't using reason.",

The images mostly likely are of archaelogical investigations of older Chukchi settlements. The Chukchi, who are still around, are nomadic tribes of Russia's high north who have been around for probably thousands of years, and their ancestors are the likely ancestors of the majority of Native Americans.\n",

It is literally impossible for there to be 'ancient' human settlements on that continent.

Because just getting there is such an enormous undertaking, we at least know that they *went* there, even if we don't know what became of them. There haven't been many such expeditions, however, so it's not like there are numerous lost artefacts to be found. Maybe half a dozen at most not already located.\n",

If you told someone you didn't have a kettle, they'd probably buy you one out of pity. If you were given an empty room to live in, the first things you'd need would be a sleeping bag, a pillow, and a kettle. Such is their importance.",

Americans prefer coffee which has other devices for preparation. Even when Amercians drink tea it is usually the weak (\"relaxing\") kind and made with hot rather than boiling water.",

Trump's $10 million is for all of his travel expenses *so far* since taking office, which has been just over 10 months. That puts Obama's average per-month travel expenses at $1.18 million and Trump's average per-month travel expenses at $1.0 million. There is no missing $94 million, and I expect if Trump continues at this trend and somehow manages to stay in office for a full two terms, he will end up with around $100 million in travel expenses himself. There really isn't a story here, or a conspiracy for that matter.",
            "&gt;  Trump's $10 million is for all of his travel expenses so far since taking office, which has been just over 10 months.\n\nJudicialWatch is reporting on FOIA requests they filed back in July, they haven't released any expenses more recent than June that I can find. So technically, the $10million is only for his first 5 months in office, and we don't have any numbers for the past 5 months yet. He's on track to spend approximately $20million in his first year.\n\nThat's also assuming that JW has found all of Trump's spending up through June. Seeing as how they're still receiving FOIA request information on the Obama Family's spending from way back in 2014, I seriously doubt Trump's is complete either.",

So far you only hear about him going to Mar-A-Lago.\n\nI would assume Donald would have seen much of the world being already rich so Obamas went to places they couldn't before."

No, offshore accounts (as long as they're reported) are not illegal, and having them does not make someone a tax cheat.\n\nBesides, if you think the issue of Romney's (Rmoney's) accounts is somehow flying-under-the-radar, you aren't paying attention.",

            "That makes a lot of sense actually. How much school for a profession that isn't viewed in that way though? ",
            "Looks like they're similarly inexpensive for public universities, 150-900 Euro/yr according to http://www.studying-in-france.org/costs-of-attending-college-in-france/\n\nPrivate schools seem to be more in line with what we experience in the US, though.",
            "Wow....\n\nWell fuck, bye America. I'm so serious. This is actually life-changing. Now I don't have to dread every day how I am going to make enough money to support myself without hating every waking hour. ",
            "Ehh, there's a problem there. You're allowed to live in the US because you were born there and all of that, but the French government might not want to let you move to France, unless you're bringing something to the table. Like, a prestigious education or a boatload of money, or something else, that in a similar way, brings value to the French society.\n\nIf you have some recent ancestors from one of the EU countries that allow [Jus sanguinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis), you can get a citizenship in a EU country, and then you can.. more easily (but not effortlessly), move to another EU country.\n\nAlso, remember to learn French. \n\n",
            "Thank you for the information. I know it won't be easy but it's a really interesting path to consider pursuing. Maybe not France, but we'll see. Thank you again.",

            "Wow. I really can't believe I've just brushed off these realities for so long. Time to really get investigating! ",
            "I felt the same way when I learned that U.S. tuition costs aren't \"normal\" compared to much of the world. There are other challenges of course, like finding courses in English, and the hoops to jump through for moving to another country.",
            "Setting aside visa/application issues for someone coming from outside France, how competitive is admission to the programs ?  For example, how many applicants are there for each available spot in medical school ?\n\nAnd you'll need to be able to speak French.\n\nAnd of course once you have a French medical degree, you can't just go straight back to USA or wherever and practice medicine.",
            "No clue, it's something I have to research. Not necessarily medical school, or France, or planning to come back to the US. Just.... a country with school I can afford that would give me a job I liked.",

            "No, but whatever country I wanted to move to, I'd learn their native language.",
            "Good luck getting in without being fluent already. Americans don't realize how lax we are for entrance, even legally.",
            "Doesn't lax mean it is easy to get in?\n\nI'd be fluent before I tried to move into the country.... Not sure what you're trying to say really.",
            "Yes, lax means easy. The US's entrance requirements for average people (not refugees) is insanely low. Most people emigrating from the US find that a harsh reality when other countries simply wont let them in.",
            "Well, when there's a will, there's a way, and we'll see if I have the will. ",
            "I really didn't want to be a b*tch and tell the other guy he's wrong, so I'll make my reply to you instead ;)\n\nI am American and have been living in France for the past 7 years. I came here and spoke not one word of French. **Not. One. Word**. And that is exactly how I was able to get here: student visa. I enrolled in a French course (20 hours a week was the minimum requirement to get the visa) and learned French while living here.\n\nI'm not saying that the actual visa process wasn't a bit complicated, but definitely don't listen to anyone telling you that you'll have a hard time getting into *any* country without speaking the language. Especially in 2018, when a lot of countries are looking for English teachers. ",
            "You can also find [courses taught in English](https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/studying-abroad/where-can-you-study-abroad-english) and many universities provide language tuition for non-native students.\n\nCan I also ask, did you really not know that this was a thing? The American healthcare and higher-education systems are widely seen as the models to avoid by the rest of the world.",

You know, for everyday use.",

            "http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones\n\ntl;dr, the only known affect of non-ionizing radiation is heating.  It's not linked to cancer the way ionizing radiation is.\n\nCellphones emit non-ionizing radiation only.  In fact, the radiation emitted by a cellphone is generally between 16cm and 42cm.  Whereas light needs to be at around 200nm to do damage, or around 1 million times more energetic.\n\nThey have to be this weak in order to be useful, only visible light and radio waves can punch through the atmosphere.  For comparison, visible light ranges from 750-350nm, and we receive far more of it and radio waves from the sun than from our cellphones.",
            "An initial problem with the article is the use of the blanket term 'radiation'. It's a nice scary word in a world terrified by nuclear weapons and power plant meltdowns, but it's a bit like saying 'food will make you fat!'. What kind of food? How much? How often? Does simply walking into your kitchen immediately turn you into a balloon? What about if you eat a few biscuits a day? A week?\n\nA number of different organisations have studied the potential dangers of cellphone emissions, and the results have been indecisive at best.\n\nAs for the 5 suggestions... well, they're functionally reasonable if one assumes that one's phone is in fact dangerously radioactive, but they render the phone barely usable. Might as well add:\n\n6) Submerge the phone in the center of a swimming pool. Water is very resistant to many forms of radiation, and this approach is used by all nuclear power plants to control radiation.",
            "Ever heard of  radiator? why was no one afraid of this, despite it being invented appx 1856 and the atomic age began in 1945?\n\nRadiators heated up our homes, but had no one railing against the dangerous gamma waves or beta particles coming out of it, despite it having RADIATION in the NAME. why?\n\nBecause it is somehow understood with that, but not cell phones, microwaves, or tvs, that radiation is the act of giving off a form of energy. the way YOU RADIATE HEAT every day, or lightbulbs RADIATE light upon you. The light is given off and spreads throughout the room. \n\nI'd say i can't wait for this stupid fad against tech to end, but i know that those idiots will only make up more bullshit about the next piece of tech that comes out.",
            "I mean yeah, cell phone radiation *is* real. But it isn't dangerous. At this point we can just look at it anecdotally - if it were dangerous, we'd see millions of people developing brain tumors, since cell phones have been in heavy use for at least a couple decades now.\n\nBut nope, not seeing any noticeable change in tumor growth."

If he had it his way you would all be sheep in a wacked out, 100% government controlled nation with no free enterprise. Oh..not true? Ever heard of extreme left wing nut Frank Marshall Davis? He got so out of control his actions were being tracked by the FBI. Obama considers this man a mentor of his. Do your actual research on this before saying that it's all bullshit.",

            "There used to be regulations about news organisation being balanced, but they were removed in the 1980s. The idea was that there was limited access to the broadcast spectrum and it was a privilege to be able to broadcast. But cable changed all that.",
            "Probably refers to [this](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/foxlies.asp).",
            "Yeah, this was the closest thing I could find as well.",
            "They do a lot of commentary on the news. Sean, bill, tucker are all commentators and don't do actual investigative reporting. That's my guess.",
            "Those shows were all designed to mimic the op-ed sections of newspapers via a tv show.  ",
            "As others have stated there are not any regulations that Fox is avoiding, but it does make a distinction between when it is showing News and when it is showing opinion shows.  In the sense that Fox deflects complaints about lacking accuracy and truthfulness with the defense that O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. are doing an opinion program and not acting as news casters per se. This is to shirk accusations of dishonesty in media rather than avoid any actual regulations though.",
            "Little late to the party but I think your coworker worded his argument incorrectly. Its smart on Fox News part to label their programs as entertainment as it does not have to take responsibility for the positions that its most popular hosts take. Even those programs still purport to be \"news\" they are clearly opinion based programs no different from talk radio and it is not their problem if their viewers don't look to see what programs are opinion based and whats news.\n\n Even on Fox News own term of use it states the information on its website is used for the viewers enjoyment and entertainment. And Ailes the former CEO had even stated in an interview that he did not view CNN and NBC as competitors but ESPN and TNT. Doesnt prove anything but interesting to compare yourself to entertainment networks and still claim to be a news network. \n\nNow your co worker is wrong to say fox news is classified as entertainment as they do actually have a news program, (although them sharing one side of the story is a whole different debate) however their most popular programs like bill o'riley and sean hannity  are where the majority of their views and \"news come from. In that case then the news most of thier views are getting can be classified as entertainment and can be extreamly misleading.",
            "I had erroneously assumed that on Debunk This people would use sources.",
            "\"regulations regarding factual reporting\" There is no such thing.",
            "Not in the US, but as u/Wolfsburg mentioned, [Canada](http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/a-law-against-lying-on-the-news) has such a law.",
            "He's likely referring to when News Corp split into a 'media and entertainment' division and a publishing division in 2012. Fox News was lumped in the media and entertainment side while publications like WSJ were put on the the publishing side. Some took that as referring to Fox as entertainment though was probably more of a business decision.",
            "The 1st amendment would forbid the government to restrict freedom of the press.",
            "The US used to do it all the time. One huge example was the [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine). None of the Amendments are absolute. "
