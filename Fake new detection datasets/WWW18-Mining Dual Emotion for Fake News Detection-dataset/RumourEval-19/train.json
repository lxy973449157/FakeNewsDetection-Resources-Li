Not sure if I want to see it debunked or … bunked.",
            "https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success\n\nYeah so it's actually worse than that if you look into the full story. ",
            "That 17:1 ratio is a big anomaly though. That's what makes it worthy of a whole article. \n\nIt says:\n\n&gt; In more recent history, as a global average, about four or five women reproduced for every one man.\n\nWhich is closer to the 80:40 claim but way higher. ",
            "It's certainly not true today. Census numbers show that the number of women who have given birth is in the 50-60% range and the number of men who have fathered a child in the 40-50% range.\n\nHistorically, however, there was a lot of pressure and expectation on women to conceive. In many cultures it was considered their only purpose and value. Whereas there has always been a place for the celibate man, I wouldn't be totally shocked if those numbers weren't way off counting all of human history."

            "Lol natural news.\n\nOn a serious note, even if the 97% consensus is \"bunk\" the science is not.\n\nEdit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:\n\nFirstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.\n\nThe way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying \"something causes itself\". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.\n\nNow where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.\n\nI hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.\n\n(I'm a student in my 3rd year of environmental science with year 1 being mostly CC so AMA I guess?) ",
            "Oh oh, Skeptoid did an episode about this recently! Another important thing to note is that we can tell the difference between carbon sources based on the amount of C14 isotopes they have. Since C14 is made in the atmosphere and likes to decay, things that are alive have proportions of C14 to C12 in line with the atmosphere, with some notable exceptions. Things that are dead lose their C14 as it decays to the more stable C12. Since the stuff we're concerned about is \"fossil fuel\", fuel derived from the remains of long-dead life forms, it has no remaining C14. We can check the proportion of our atmosphere composed of C14 to C12 and tell that the vast majority of added carbon in the CO2 is C12. The only other real source of massive amounts of C12 being pumped into the atmosphere is volcanoes, and we know how much CO2 they're pumping out. It's much less than the increase of CO2 we're experiencing, doesn't explain the increase.",
            "I know the consensus is real, but I would like to specifically debunk the info in this particular article.   I see that the quotes in the article are taken from a book about climate denial. Here are some links I usually use to support the consensus: \n\nhttps://skepticalscience.com/debunking-climate-consensus-denial.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change\n\nhttps://www.opr.ca.gov/s_listoforganizations.php",
            "This is the entire problem with using bandwagon fallacies as an argument for something. You end up arguing things that really shouldn't matter - it doesn't matter whether 2, 50 or 97% of scientists \"endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming\" - and arguing the percentage is a waste of time. If they want to argue against man made climate change they need to provide evidence that the climate isn't changing due to man's actions.\n\nStill - here we are.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists, the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others. The site seems to ignore these.\n\nThe other things that jump out at me are.\n\n&gt; the researchers then selected 79 of their sample and declared them “experts.\"\n\nWell no the researchers did not do that, those surveyed did - by publishing papers on climate change - it shouldn't be a surprise that out of 3,146 scientists only 79 of them were climate scientists... It's a poor way to decide if man made climate change is correct or not - but I don't think the poll claims that it is.\n\n&gt; So if I send out an email survey to 1000 people, and then I hand-pick the 75 responses I like the best, then can I proclaim those results to be \"settled science\" too? Will Al Gore champion my cause and demand billions in reparations from first world nations on my behalf?\n\nNo because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.\n\nSo sure, if we ignore all other surveys that confirm the statistic - then this alone as a support for anthropomorphic climate change is weak, usefully there are other things supporting man made climate change other than one email poll.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Ew",
            "you would think this guy would know bunk when he sees it. look at all the bunk for sale on that page alone",
            "The linked article does have an element of truth in it, in that the statistic is often stated incorrectly. The [Doran (2009) study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/eost2009EO03/epdf) found that 97% of those respondents with the greatest level of expertise in climate science agreed that \"human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures.\"  The NaturalNews article seems to suggest that these respondents were cherry-picked to produce the desired result, but they represented those \"who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change.\" This is naturally going to be a much smaller subset of scientists, but it includes those whose knowledge and expertise is arguably most relevant.\n\nThis result is often shorthanded in public discourse to \"97% of scientists agree,\" but that's not an issue of scientific fraud.  The scientists explained it fully in their publication.\n\nIt's also relevant (but not addressed in the NaturalNews article) that several independent studies have been done using different methods, and reached very similar conclusions. [This skepticalscience.com article](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) provides a good overview.\n\n",

The lib dems/non-corbyn labour/conservatives/ ukip all over lap in some areas (whether they like it or not). And this is where people often move parties.",
            "To be fair, the greens didn't have much to trail off from.",
            "There is also the obvious point that if young people did vote the Tories would make a greater effort to try to appeal to them, so the numbers should not be taken as constant.\n\nIf I've learned anything from the NUS, its that it is really easy to get students to get on your team if you do something simple that appeals to them.",

I'll drag out the table when I open up my computer, but one of the questions was \"which party do you usually associate with\" and it had Labour marginally ahead (you'd also need to look at Scotland of course). ",
            "As far as I can see BES only make their data available in SPSS and Stata formats, which while I have access to at work is a bit more than I want to deal with on a hungover Sunday morning.",
            "Yeah they do. I put it into PSPP and then copied and pasted it into excel. It's big though because they ask 450 odd questions to 3k people. \n\nI'd share, but the answers are often coded, so don't make sense (eg who did you vote for has answers of 1, 2, 3, etc which relate to parties).

Probably you would have to say that even in the 100% voting case that they still wouldn't or would spoil their ballot because they don't support any party.\n\nI might have a play with incorporating that later, right now I should probably do the work that this procrastination was designed to avoid while still feeling like I was being productive.",

            "Well, perhaps, but it could equally well be described as 'simplistic and inaccurate'.\n\nTurnout varies enormously by social grade, with 72% turnout from those in grade AB and 57% turnout from those in DE.  AB voters lean Conservative (45% Con, 26% Lab) and DE voters lean Labour (27% Con, 41% Lab).  Both groups account for roughly 25% of the population.\n\nSo it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate).  To do that meaningfully you'd need (good) polling data dividing the population up by both criteria, though, and I'm not sure such data exists.",

            "That claim is based on the books \"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\", by David Grossman; and \"Men against Fire\", by SLA Marshall.\n\nI'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.\n\nMarshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that 75% of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.\n\nIn fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.\n\nThere is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.\n\nSo this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.\n\nIf you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.\n\nEngen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.\n\nCanadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!\n\nSo - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.\n\nIf you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are:\n\nhttp://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo9/no2/16-engen-eng.asp\n\nhttp://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1081/1/Engen_Robert_C_200803_MA.pdf\n\nIn the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:\n\nhttp://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo9/18-grossman-eng.asp",
            "*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.  I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them.  It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true.  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?\n\nThe major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:\n\n&gt; \"Everyone stop!  OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him.\"\n\nAlmost everything in this area is laced with bias.  Soldiers don't want to be seen as cowards, commanders want to believe their men are good fighters, very few people understand what battle is actually like, very few psychologists are soldiers, very few soldiers are psychologists and it is very rare to find scholars with relevant military experience who can combine academic rigour in both history and psychology.  *On the Psychology of Military Incompetence* by Norman Dixon is a good example: Dixon was a Major in the Royal Engineers and an esteemed psychologist, but the historical section of his book is extremely suspect - especially his treatment of World War One.\n\nAgainst this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research.  What is not in any doubt is that western militaries have gone to great lengths since the end of World War Two to develop sophisticated, realistic training environments to prepare soldiers for battle and develop instinctive responses to stimuli: in effect to stop the soldier from thinking.",
            "&gt;  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?\n\nWhat on earth?",
            "Sleeping bags are comforting, and a bombardment can be *really* scary.  Also, there were accusations of incredible negligent and shoddy leadership on the Argentinian side (there were trials regarding to extremely poor treatment of the conscripts fairly recently), which would explain very poor reactions to incoming fire.  [Der Speigel article on the accusations](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/argentina-s-falklands-war-veterans-cannon-fodder-in-a-war-we-couldn-t-win-a-475287.html)\n\nIn general, people do not act rationally when put under sudden and extreme stress, especially if there isn't any stable presence to guide their reactions.  If your commander is telling you to get to bunkers, directing you to positions, and acting like he's still in control of the situation, you're going to have a much better chance of reacting well.  Absent or poor leadership?  You're now scared, and have no idea what to do in this new, scary situation.  ",
            "[deleted]",
            "As far as I know that term usually applies to the lack of knowledge of enemy unit positions rather than battlefield confusion.",
            "I'll have to hunt out the exact passage if you want more gen, but despite having better places to take cover they resorted to using sleeping bags.  Remember that these were poorly trained conscripts. not professional soldiers.",
            "Also, Grossman cherry picks his battles. He commonly claims that artillery and other crew served weapons do the majority of killing even in a direct action, yet one can with very little trouble find several battles where one or both sides had little trouble inflicting terrific casualties on the other using accurate and deliberate fire, without artillery being involved. The Battle of Inkerman would be my favourite example. ",
            "In other words, all those bullets went somewhere?",
            "Above all, the Allied infantry was more than willing to lay fire at their oncoming Russian counterparts with devastating accuracy, which runs counter to Grossman's entire thesis. ",
            "This is a great answer. I have read all 3 books you mention, discussed it with professors and veterans. Many people agree that his number is either fabricated or based off a \"gut feeling.\" \n\nWhat is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. \n\nFor Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things. Like /u/kombatminipig said, he is very selective in his evidence.\n\nFinally Engen. All I can say is that he is a top notch academic, and *Canadians Against Fire* is a solid piece of work. \n\n",
            "Could someone track down the records of ammunition given to each soldier before and after each battle and from there find out how many soldiers fired their weapons?  Or do those records not exist?",
            "If the records did exist, they wouldn't prove that the soldiers fired their weapons at the enemy, just that they were fired at all.",
            "I feel like Grossman would argue that the ammo was discarded, or given to the few that were firing, and that everyone then lied about where it went. Because camaraderie.",
            "You could also check the guns to determine if they'd been fired.  Soldiers trading weapons to hide the fact that some aren't doing their jobs seems unreasonably complicated.",
            "Well, we can't check the guns of WWII soldiers now, and I would be surprised to find a primary source on that suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nAmmo consumption would be possible to find sources on, I'm just not sure how fine grained it would be. Probably down to battalion level at least, maybe company, probably not platoon.",
            "[removed]",
            "&gt; Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that 75% of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.\n\nTough to extrapolate onto the soldiers KIA who would likely have had a far higher ratio.",
            "An interesting thing to consider. ",
            "This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the 15%-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.\n\nFor one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only 15-20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).\n\nWhile his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?\n\n[This](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a 50% fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.\n\nSimply put... it's just not very good history. It's hard to get a proper number for how many soldiers fired their guns, but the 15-20% is more or less impossible to back up, and completely ignores several significant factors.",
            "It's also talking about \"at an exposed enemy soldier\".  Meaning that pointing in the general direction of the enemy doesn't count.  But, per an earlier comment, the soldier can still be firing their weapon and therefore using up ammunition and causing wear on their gun barrel.",
            "Isn't the term American riflemen referring to Marines, making those arguments about their duties etc null?",
            "The term \"riflemen\" can be applied to everyone with a rifle. I believe you are thinking of the phrase \"Every marine is a rifleman\". While that is true, the reverse is not (Not every rifleman is a marine).",
            "Firstly, no, \"riflemen\" is not specific to the Marines.\n\nSecondly, I suspect you're referring to \"every Marine is a rifleman first.\" This does not mean that the Marines consist of no role but infantry riflemen, but only that Marines of all roles are expected to be competent to effectively engage in combat with a rifle. The Marines still have people performing all the different duties that any other branch does.",
            "Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:\n\n&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average 100 men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only 15 men on average would take any part with the weapons.  This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25% of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...\n\nMarshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today.  [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy.  (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill.  These weren't firing lines 100 yards apart.  Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)\n\nStill, after WWII they led to innovations in training to increase rate of fire.",
            "Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind 20% of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ 0 (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like \"Brennan’s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall’s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army\ncaptain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not\nrecall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the\njournalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea.\" ^1\n\nI would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between 25,000 to 100,000 rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).\n\nI also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.\n\n\nI apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ .\n\n\nOn a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire. \n\n\n\nReferences:\n0.

One group of soldiers, firing from cover, works to get as much lead flying in the general direction of the opposition in an attempt to hinder their ability to fire on another group of their comrades that are relocating elsewhere.

Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:\n\n&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. \n\nIt all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its \"highly reliable source\". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.\n\n&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.\"\n\nSeems entirely reasonable.\n\nThe Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should \"think very carefully\", that means that \n\n&gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. \n\nand that therefore\n\n&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is?\n\nPretty unimpressive from The Sun.",

            "I think even if thise were true (and I am highly doubtful it is) then it's not exactly a revelation. I think pretty much everyone thinks the EU is heading in the wrong direction. The question is what do we do about it. The remain group want to stay and reform it, using the influence of being in the group to make changes. The leave group believe it is beyond reform and never will be what we want.\n\nAlso denying backing Brexit does not mean that she supports staying, that's a fallacy.",
            "Some people actually like the direction the EU is going in. Also 'reform' can mean a lot. The more Eurosceptic remain supporters want to see a weaker more diluted EU while the more ardent supporters want to see a stronger EU. I personally would support an even more unified Europe but I'm also a filthy pseudo-foreigner (Irish).",
            "So I understand the appeal of a unified europe, even to the extent of a federal entity with current nations as states. But what do you feel about the direction that this is going with regard to things like the lack of accountability in elections?\n\nFor example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#Appointment\n\nWell why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over 50 million?\n\nSurely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",
            "Did you vote for Cameron to become Prime Minister? No, you voted for an MP and he was selected by MPs.\n\nThis is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too. It should be someone appointed by and who commands a majority of the EU parliament, this is how many countries select their leader and I have no problem with that. Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.\n\nAlso don't forget, everything the EU tries to pass MUST be approved by EU parliament which has proportional representation and Britain due to its population has a gigantic number of MEPs representing it. ",
            "And that would be fine if Junker were the leader of the largest party of MEPs and campaigned as their leader during the election. That would be transparency.\n\nCameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability. I doubt the US population would be happy with their president being selected by all the state governors under the argument that any law has to be passed by the House anyway.\n\nThis is not even close to democratic. FPTP for all its flaws at least is an election. Why are you supporting a system that diminishes the power of voters?",
            "Well the US president is selected by the electoral college who do have the power to ignore the popular vote but obviously that is not really relevant.\n\nThe EU is trying to make the election of the president more transparent. Bizarrely, it's the people who argue that the EU needs reform such as Cameron who oppose such changes. \n\nAlso I support the EU because as an Irish citizen, I have seen directly the good it has done for my country. I also see real attempts to make the system fairer and more democratic through documents like the Lisbon treaty.",

            "Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a \"capstone of a United States of Europe\". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme.  \n\nBoth here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics. I am sick of the federal question being avoided by these people. No other trade group has a foreign minister and serious proposals for an army, it's a farce to see people pretend this is all about trade, it's a federation.",
            "I won't dispute that Guy wants greater integration, but its disingenuous two mention that without pointing out that he is calling for a \"two speed Europe\"; i.e. the eurozone nations would pull together in order for the single currency to be effective as possible, whereas counties which want to stay out of the euro like the UK, Sweden and Poland would be \"associate members\" under his ideas, with an opt out of further integration, but full access to the single market. Which if you ask me sounds like the best way forwards for europe.",
            "I am not so sure we can take anything that's said by these people on face value anymore. Two speeds maybe, but there's only one destination. Look at the bullying of Switzerland at the moment now they have it encircled. That's what would happen to an \"associate member\" sooner or later. I can't believe that's being done partially in my name. It's a disgrace.  \n\nThese people have not stopped when the people have clearly told them to stop by shooting down treaties, I don't think we can consider them to be playing an honest democratic game at this point.",
            "&gt; Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a \"capstone of a United States of Europe\"...\n\nThere are many things to criticise Clegg for but attacking him because someone who wasn't even an MEP until 2009 (Clegg stood down as an MEP in 2004), who now leads the political group that didn't exist until after Clegg left the European Parliament (and which formed out of a merger of the group Clegg was part of and another group), is an EU Federalist, is a bit of a stretch.",

Please attack my opinions...\n\nI actually have a lot of respect for The Queen, when I said I didn't believe her to be this stupid I meant it. My belief is that The Sun is misrepresenting or misinterpreting her words. I hope you don't see this as a personal attack on her, when I really didn't mean it maliciously.\n\nThis is sort of unrelated but something you bought up: Do you extend the honour of 'seeing us through the great depression' to anyone who was alive during the time, I certainly don't see how our current Queen had any influence on it. Being as she was, roughly 4 years old when it started.",

            "she did like doing nazi salutes though",
            "Although she is a symbol of Britain the issue arises from how the British system of government is set up. The British system entirely relies on convention which is what stops the queen from exercising her power to stop legislation passed in parliament and the Lords from blocking money bills. However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements. This means that the monarch backing a political narrative is an issue because it goes against the convention that the monarchy stays out of politics and strides close to the queen actually influencing legislation which can't happen in a democracy.

She didn't get to that age by skipping it, y'know.  \n\nThe whole story sounds like a poor attempt to galvanize people, and sounds pretty fictional to me.

            "The Queen is famous about keeping quiet about her political views. Unfortunately, this was likely going to happen at some point because she made a rare point of telling people she wished Scotland would stay in the Union. Given the intelligence she shows in her speeches, somehow I doubt she'd be privy to hypocrisy the likes of which the Sun is accusing her of, but then again the Sun is a Murdoch machine and I wouldn't be surprised if they claimed that Jesus and Winston Churchill were Brexiters as well.",

While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen. Copying and pasting ruins the formatting, so here's a short sample:\n\n- The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a “No” vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:\n- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.\n- All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.\n- Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this (such as EEA membership or similar) would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer.\n- While these timescales cannot be “known”, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. \n- Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.\n- A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from 1989 to 1994\n- 12.6% of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU, while only 3.1% of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK. Any proposition that that “they need us more than we need them” and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn’t hold up.\n- The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails:\n- Large membership fees\n- Freedom of movement\n- Following a vast majority of the laws\n- All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.\n\nEDIT: I hate formatting.",

            "&gt;It has been known for some years that the problem with microwaved anything is not the radiation people used to worry about, it’s how it corrupts the DNA in the food so the body can not recognize it.\n\nJunk science alert! The body doesn't give a tinkers cuss about the DNA of food you ingest, it cares about things like proteins, which are a product of DNA. Oh, and water doesn't have DNA. Or proteins, for that matter.\n\n&gt;What about the nurse in Canada that warmed up blood for a transfusion patient and accidentally killed him when the blood went in dead\n\nIf that actually happened, that is the stupidest nurse ever to pass the exams. Yes, microwaving blood will damage or destroy the blood cells. But there is a world of difference between eating something and injecting it directly into your veins.",

            "1. Microwaved water is just normal water, but hotter. The microwave radiation does not persist on objects, they are even lower energy than visible light, and just a little higher than radio waves. Radiation itself can not persist on objects for long periods of time, only radio emitters such as uranium, which can give a steady stream of radiation pose any risk whatsoever (rest assured your microwave does not contain uranium)\n\n2. Most microwaves no not use water resonance to heat, but instead use dielectric heating (is is more efficient), which uses a rapidly changing electric field to spin polar molecules, causing heating in most materials equally. It functions a little like an induction cooktop"

            "Just curious here, why would sleeping with our heads *away* from the door be a survival instinct?",
            "Yeah, I sleep with my head toward the door. \n\nDoes... that mean I'm not long for this world??",

            "So you always have a view of your door in case someone walks in that you need to fight off. Someone or something....",
            "Okay, so why would you face AWAY from it if you want a view of the door?!?!",
            "So we can pop our heads up, look over our feet at the door in case somebody walks in. If we sleep with their head pointing towards the door, we would have to flip around to see the person and they would have their hands around our neck a lot more quickly. So basically we instinctively point our feet towards the door. I believe that's what the guy is saying and I have read that somewhere.",
            "Damn, I'm an idiot sometimes. I was picturing someone laying parralel to the door, with either the front of their body facing the door, or the back of their body facing the door. ",

            "The WHO says the evidence for the magnetic field of the Earth's effect on human health is weak to non-existent. Moveover, the effects would be due to electro-magnetic radiation, if anything, rather than something simple like \"magnetics pull the metals in your body one way.\" That would be easily observable and uncontroversial if that were possible, which it evidently is not.\n\nPlus, Indians do a lot of weird stuff, as anyone around the world does. Most folk science is more folk than science.",
            "&gt;most folk science is more folk than science\n\nholy shit, reading that i just realized that \"folklore\" is composed by the english words \"folk\" and \"lore\", like lore of the folks. i never noticed that. (I'm not native english speaker btw)",
            "Yep! Etymology can be pretty fun. What is your first language?",
            "portuguese. in portuguese, the word \"folklore\" translates to \"folClore\". \"folc\" and \"lore\" doesn't mean anything in portuguese, so i guess we got the word from english",
            "Ohh, interesting! It's always a fun surprise when words cross languages. Russian borrows a lot from English, and English borrows a lot from German. And that's ignoring the German and French origins of a lot of English words, which most people aren't even aware of. Linguistics!",
            "&gt;\tEnglish borrows a lot from German.  \n\nbut then  \n\n&gt;...that's ignoring the German... origins of a lot of English words...    \n\nWait... what?  \n\nAlso, English words are mostly of Latin origin. French and German origins are slightly less common. ",
            "Oh, I forgot to mention that while Latin does heavily influence English, a great deal of that came from French (Norman) influence. English is a strange mixture of Latin roots, and prior to that, a variety of Germanic roots. That's all on top of the original British roots. You might like English to a whirlpool of European languages focused atop England.",
            "The difference I was explaining was words borrowed vs. words etymologically derived. For example, *wanderlust* and *delicatessan* we straight up borrow from German, and an ESL speaker whose native language isn't German wouldn't know that. \n\n*Answer*, however, is not a borrowed word, but an English word which was introduced to the English lexicon from the Proto-Germanic language. This is because English developed with influence from the Germanic people coming to England hundreds of years ago, notably the Frisians, Saxons, and Danes. When they went to England, whether trading or settling, the English language evolved to accommodate. \n\nSo now you see what I mean? There is German influence from pre-Old English that have Germanic origins from hundreds of years ago, and there are German words that English borrowed very recently without changing or integrating the word.\n\nTo a non-English and non-German speaker, this might be interesting.",
            "Oh yeah! I get what you’re saying now. Yes, English borrows from French and German very frequently!! Disregard my other comment. ",

            "It is a very common belief in India. Even highly educated people fall for it as such pseudoscience is often peddled by religious people(just search Sadhguru if you want).",

            "Smart!",
            "I read a folklore (northern hemisphere) where you were supposed to point your bed North, so it's contradictory.",
            "The earth's magnetic field ranges in strength from 25 to about 65 microteslas (µT). If you have ever had a MRI you have been subjected to a magnetic field of about 1.5 T - around 23,000 times stronger than the earth's magnetic field at the Poles. And yet it probably had no noticeable effect on you. The earth's weak magnetic field will most likely be drowned out by other sources of EM radiation right in your room - your cell phone, laptop, AC/DC converters etc. We have been using devices that emit EM radiation for quite a long time now - and have yet to see any negative effects.",
            "This is silly, but I'd like to know why some Asian religious traditions have taught people to sleep on *their* left side (the left side of their body.)",
            "I remember reading that it's because if you are attacked while you sleep your heart is better protected...I also remember reading that this was some sort of Ninja and/or Samurai practice. I'm sure I read this on the internet somewhere, so I have no Idea how true it is. \n\nAlso there's the fact that the heart is mainly central in the chest, with only a slight left tilt so I'm not sure how effective this would be anyway. ",
            "If we are going to build from the initial though of self defence then one might consider it would be better to have greater mobility of your right hand (most people being right handed) also reduces the odds that if you are attacked in your sleep then your right hand is less likely to have fallen asleep.\n\nPretty sure it's all just silly folklore though.",
            "I guess when the poles shift some people are going to have a really bad nights sleep... and others a really epic one... until we wake up in the morning and some stuff don't work no more.",
            "I live in the southern hemisphere and if I point my bed in any direction it just snaps straight back to North or South.",

            "There are two NSA programs – one that gathers U.S. phone records (metadata) and another that is designed  to track the use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism.\n\nYou are mixing info on the two in a failed attempt to make a point.\n\nPhone metadata: This includes the “call pairs” — the two phone numbers on a call, plus the date, time and duration of the call.\n\nEmail metadata: The “to” and “from” email addresses, along with the IP addresses and subject lines. Basically it’s the same information you’d see on the envelope of a postal letter.\n\nSimilar metadata *WAS* collected for text messages, Facebook DMs and the like. The purpose of metadata is to weed out your cat meme emails, which NSA doesn’t care about nor does it read or retain, and to zero in on real suspects for targeted surveillance (which, as you’ll read below, requires an individual warrant for U.S. persons).\n\nWhat is “minimization?” This is the procedure NSA uses to safeguard the privacy of American citizens. Part of this process includes the anonymization/encryption of personal information, transforming proper names, for example, into random strings of characters called “designators.”\n\n[this facet of Stellar Wind was discontinued by the Obama administration in 2011.]\n\nhttp://thedailybanter.com/2013/07/a-stellar-wind-primer-what-exactly-are-we-talking-about-regarding-the-nsa/\n\nThe Washington Post has revised its article. Just one day later, with no acknowledgment except for a \nchange in the timestamp, the Post revised the story, \nbacking down from sensational claims it made originally. But the damage was already done. \nThe article no longer reports that the tech companies gave \nthe NSA \"Unrestricted direct access to servers\". \nBut, more importantly, the phrase “track a person’s movements and contacts over time” was revised to \n“track foreign targets.” There’s a huge difference between the two phrases. \nPublic outrage was almost entirely based on the idea that the NSA was spying on everyone who uses those services, \nbroad, unrestricted access to private information. \nBut the revision limits the scope of the operation to *international communications*.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-updates-spying-story-2013-6 \n\nAccording to The Washington Post. \"PRISM gives the U.S. government access to email, documents, audio, video, \nphotographs and other data belonging to foreigners on foreign soil who are under investigation.\"\n\nAre you a foreigner on foreign soil who is under investigation?\n\n\"It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so.\" TRUE!\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/\n\nFrom YOUR link. [when you read past the hyperbolic headline, down at the bottom, you find this.]\n\n\"The top secret documents published today detail the circumstances in which data collected on US persons under the foreign intelligence authority must be destroyed, extensive steps analysts must take to try to check targets are outside the US, and reveals how US call records are used to help remove US citizens and residents from data collection.\"\n\n\n",
            "The NY Times article is confusingly worded. The same part from Reuters says:\n&gt;In the future, the Justice Department would not seek warrants in relation to reporters \"if the sole purpose is the investigation of a person other than the member of the news media,\" the report said.\n\nIn other words, they won't be seeking warrants to search through reporters files if they're investigating someone who isn't a member of the news media.\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/12/us-usa-justice-warrant-media-idUSBRE96B0RC20130712",

Keep in mind that the budget isn't smaller, so they are basically increasing the quality of each episode even more. Each episode is like a 1-hour quality movie rather than some pay cable fantasy show."

            "[Actual quote from President Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):\n\n&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.\n\nPresident Trump [left for the UK on Friday 24th June](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday 24th June](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746272130992644096) - around 10am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746273889160957952) around 10.30am.\n\nNo matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.\n\nThe guy couldn't remember basic facts.\n\n-------\n\nOther gems from the press conference. The whole \"fake news\" for reporting what he said thing, saying \"We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before\" - interesting use of \"wealthy\" there.\n\nOn meeting with President Putin:\n\n&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it’s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I’ll be talking about nuclear proliferation.\n\nOn Nato spending:\n\n&gt; I say we pay 90 percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.\n\nHe can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/) of [sources](https://www.nato.int/cps/ie/natohq/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.\n\nOn immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:\n\n&gt;  It’s not good for Europe and it’s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We’re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don’t have immigration laws — I don’t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you’re tied in a lawsuit for five years.\n\nOn the UK-US special relationship:\n\n&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it’s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough — if they don’t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It’s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.\n\nOn Russia invading Ukraine:\n\n&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea — I wouldn’t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We’ll have to see what happens ... I’m not bad at doing things. Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.\n\nOn Theresa May:\n\n&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.\n\nOn the Russia meeting:\n\n&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it’s a dream, but it’s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I’m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia. People say ‘he loves Russia’ - I love the U.S. I love China and I love other countries.",

            "\"Well if you remember I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit\"\n\nFrom the press conference earlier today\n\nI mean that is a blatant lie",

            "The confusion seems to be due to time zones.\n\nBased on [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (assuming it is accurate) he left the US at roughly 2am on 24th June *UK time*, which would have been 6-9pm 23rd June *US time*. Direct commercial flights take 6-8 hours, so depending on how he travelled, he might have arrived in the UK just on 23rd June in the western parts of the US.\n\nAt a guess, President Trump's press office said he'd be flying to Scotland on Thursday 23rd (which is true), and that got repeated by the UK press by without checking for time zones, and also got turned from \"leaving on 23rd\" to \"arriving on 23rd\" by mistake.",

The BBC and ITV called the election at roughly 4.40am. All of which would have been while President Trump was on the plane.\n\nSecondly, let's look at what he actually said, based on [this transcript](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):\n\n&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if he flew into the UK on 23rd (he didn't), or if technically the result hadn't been called when he arrived (it had been), because his claim was about opening the course the day before.\n\nSo even if we take \"Brexit\" to be on 24th June (rather than the day of the vote) he was still wrong. He got his events in the wrong order.",

            "You are on the right track. A few additional points : \n\n* The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. \n* * See the fuel paradox section of this article https://medium.com/@landingattempts/why-do-rockets-use-so-much-fuel-118486244aba\n* As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)\n* *  Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.\n* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.\n* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)\n* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to \"turn around\" at the time that the accident happened\n* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian\n* During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you 30 days, or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out. ",
            "Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon (i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well) vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful :)\n\nThanks for giving me further things to google though!",
            "This image gives you quite a bit of the info basically the first and second stages are used entirely to get into earth orbit, and the third stage is for the moon and back : \n\nS1 : ~500k Gallons\nS2 : ~300k G\ns3 : ~80k G\n \nProbably unaccounted for here is the fuel to lift off from the moon, which was in separate tanks for the lunar module, and would not be that much due to the low gravity of the moon, and the much lower amount of mass being lifted. \n\nhttps://www.space.com/18422-apollo-saturn-v-moon-rocket-nasa-infographic.html",
            "Thank you!",
            "Another short debunk from a nerd's perspective: play kerbal space program, and one of the first things you do is figure out how to land on and return from the moon (or Mun in this case). The key observation is the amount of fuel needed to get your initial rocket into orbit, vs the amount to return your tiny escape capsule home. \n\nIt's on the order of 100x as much. ",
            "I could show him, but he's not big on video games. Solid suggestion though!",
            "YouTube videos of Kerbal gameplay might be good. Apollo reenactment is popular with players.\n\nFacts rarely work on such people, but archive.org has all the radio transmissions from the Apollo flights, including from on the way back to Earth. \n\nThere's footage of reentry from inside the capsule too, but don't press too hard.\n\nThis is about the maneuver to return to Earth, and the linked pages are also useful. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Earth_injection\n...\nI was having fun looking things up, here's the original manual for the engine that got them home from the Moon:\nhttps://history.nasa.gov/afj/aoh/aoh-v1-2-04-sps.pdf",

He's sensitive to science based arguments; he works as a plumber, very defensive of his intelligence toward both of his uni educated kids. I'm not trying to prove him wrong, more trying to get him with the program, he's holding himself and his view of the world back by clinging to this theory. It (mildly) infuriates me, as he's not otherwise a conspiracy nut.\n\nAnd as with everyone else who contributed: thank you for helping me out!",
            "I'd be hesitant to use that simply because it _is_ a game. Despite how accurate or analogous it may be, there's still the easy out of \"It's just a damn game, they can make it do whatever they want\".\n\nIf anything, it might strengthen his belief in the conspiracy.",

            "Per my answer, thats actually not really true. The vast majority of the rocket was just to get us into Earth orbit. It only costs a fraction of additional fuel to get to the moon and back once you make it into space.\n\nThats why things like the space elevator, or space mining are so attractive, because if you start in space, or can get to space cheaply, moving around in space is already cheap.",

            "Actually, he is right, kind of.  Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively.  Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use.  It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes.  \n\nIs nicotine good for you?  No, its not.  It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems.  However, caffeine and ethanol are both \"not good\" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects.  It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the \"worst\" thing in a cig.\n\nJust to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.\n\n&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK — Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.\n\nNicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction\n\n\nAlso, wikipedia has alot of this information.\n\nNow, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe.  This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent.  This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe.  They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient.  My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.",
            "Any decent e-cig has a silica wick than can't burn, and nicotine juice is pretty simple stuff, some ratio or another of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin nicotine and some flavorings. Not much you can cut corners on and still get decent \"smoke.\" Propylene glycol has a pretty good body of research saying it's harmless in the quantities you could possibly be smoking, it's used for medical vaporizers. Vegetable glycerin I'm admittedly not so sure of, but so far as I know there's no known issues caused by vaporizing it. I suppose the various flavorings added could theoretically cause issues, it's hard to say exactly what they're made of. That said, I'd put a good amount of money on most people having zero or negligible health impact from the non-nicotine components of e-cig juice. Unless you're smoking those sketchy cheapo things they sell at gas stations. ",
            "A straight forward cigarette has minimal ingredients but the tobacco companies have added many things to increase their addictiveness and lethality.  The same can easily be done for e-cigs.  I don't think it has yet but it certainly can be.",
            "Those of us that vape shop from companies that self regulate, though I agree that regulation is a good thing, but over-regulation like the FDA is proposing will effectively kill off the majority of manufacturers and vendors.\n\nPeer reviewed studies, a lot of them, showing that ecigs are of minimal to no health concern: http://onvaping.com/the-ultimate-list-of-studies-on-e-cigarettes-and-their-safety/\n\nAlso nicotine is not as addictive as you make it out to be, tobacco is.  The reason is that tobacco contains both nicotine and natural Monoamine Oxidaise Inhibitors (MAOI's).  Here are a few studies on this subject:\n\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-005-0250-x#page-1\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n8/abs/1300987a.html\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305703002235",
            "The nicotine damages your heart and blood vessels by causing high blood pressure, but not your lungs.  The tar and smoke are what destroys your lungs.  \n\nBut since nicotine is the addictive element in cigarettes, one might argue that it indirectly damages your lungs by getting you hooked on the idea of pumping tar and smoke into your lungs.",
            "&gt;He compared nicotine to caffeine.\n\nNot at all comparible."
