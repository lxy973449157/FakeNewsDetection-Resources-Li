            "For example, California has what’s known as a “three-strikes” law. If you get convicted for three felonies it doesn’t matter what they are, you go to jail for life. You heard that right, we decided that people should spend their lives in prison for stealing candy bars because we thought it made a cool baseball analogy.",
            "Fuck California.\n\nThey fuck up their own state, then move to other states and proceed to fuck them up.",
            "So it is after the third strike and not on the first? Thats not too bad i guess.",
            "That's an exaggeration.  The three-strikes law only applies to persons convicted of violent crimes or serious felonies.  You can be arrested for the same misdemeanor as often as you want, that law won't apply to you.   \n\nThat law actually makes sense, because why would you want violent criminals and serious felons running around free?  Especially after they had two previous chances to correct their lives and get their shit together.",
            "Plenty of states have three-strikes laws that do not just apply to violent crimes or serious felonies. Many of these folks should be locked away.  But the fact that there are relatively harmless folks who have been deprived of a normal life and a chance to be a regular citizen is no exaggeration.\n\n[ACLU report on 3,200 non-violent offenders sentenced to life without parole in the US.](https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/111813-lwop-complete-report.pdf#page=4) Some of those crimes included things like:\n\n* attempting to cash a stolen check \n* a junk-dealer’s possession of stolen junk metal (10 valves and one elbow pipe)\n* possession of stolen wrenches \n* siphoning gasoline from a truck \n* stealing tools from a tool shed and a welding machine from a yard \n* shoplifting three belts from a department store \n* shoplifting several digital cameras \n* shoplifting two jerseys from an athletic store \n* taking a television, circular saw, and a power converter from a vacant house \n* breaking into a closed liquor store in the middle of the night",
            "Sounds like some people should have learned their lesson the first two times instead of committing the exact same crime over and over again.  I have no sympathy for criminals.  They had a choice to obey the law and not go to jail, or break the law and go to jail, and they chose the latter.  ",
            "You're heartless. Most of these people were poor and in bad situations - something coming out of prison is pretty much guaranteed to do to you.  And even then, you'll put someone behind bars *for their entire life* for stealing three belts?  What an asshole.",
            "I've been poor and in bad situations, yet I've never committed a crime.  These people aren't being placed behind bars for their entire lives for committing one crime, they're being placed behind bars for their entire lives because they would have otherwise spent their entire lives committing crimes.  \n\nYou'd think coming out of prison, you'd turn your game around in order to, oh I don't know, avoid going to prison again.  If you keep doing the same old shit, you'll get the same old punishment.",
            "Have you been homeless? Did you have schizophrenia?  Do you have no family members who are capable of financially taking care of you if you suddenly lose your job and have difficulty finding a new one immediately?\n\nThere are people with worse luck than you, I guarantee it. And still, even if you don't buy any of this, like I said: thinking someone should spend the rest of their life in prison for stealing belts makes you an asshole.  It just does.  That's not an appropriate punishment.\n\n&gt;  If you keep doing the same old shit, you'll get the same old punishment.\n\nLife in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.",
            "Being homeless or schizophrenic doesn't give you any reason or excuse to break the law.  The law is in place no matter what your situation is.  Follow the law, and stay out of prison.  Break the law, and go to prison.  It's a choice.  Some people just made the wrong choice.\n\nIf somebody lands themselves in prison for life for continuously stealing, that was their choice.  It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested.  \n\n&gt;Life in prison, by definition, can only be a punishment you receive once.\n\nNot if you're getting life in prison for committing the exact same crime three times.  Life in prison for repeat offenders makes sense.  Your sentence increases every time you repeat an offense, so eventually, your sentence will expire after you expire.  There's a way to avoid that, however.  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again.  ",
            "Being homeless doesn't give you a reason to break the law?  What?  How do you eat when you don't have a job?  Panhandling is illegal, people won't give you work...it makes sense that people resort to theft. Doesn't make it right, but a man's gotta eat.\n\nI would also disagree with you that some schizophrenics are making a choice to break the law. Some of these people have lost touch with reality.\n\n&gt;  If you commit a crime and find yourself in prison, after you get out of prison, don't do what you did to land yourself in prison again. \n\nThat's a really nice thought.  Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening.  \n\nLook, I get the whole \"you keep doing this, we're going to make it worse on you until you stop.\" But there's a whoooole lot of room between a year in prison for minor theft and the rest of your life. Sentence someone to five years, ten years.  Hell, sentence them to thirty years and that's probably *still* less than life in prison. Thirty years! For stealing three belts! Who's heartless enough to do that to a person? After thirty years your old life would be unrecognizable.  It doesn't make sense to punish someone that long because they're not even the same person they were when they committed the crime. Life in prison is *worse* than that.\n\n&gt; It doesn't matter whether I agree with the decision or not, these people made a choice to be drains on society, disregard the law, and get themselves arrested. \n\nIt does matter that you agree with that decision, because these laws won't change until most people change their minds about stuff like this.  And until then, these people will be *bigger* drains on society because, like we both agreed on, it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.",
            "&gt;How do you eat when you don't have a job? \n\nGo to a homeless shelter, or a church, or a charity.  They're always dishing out food to the homeless.  \n\n&gt;Too bad that if you're in prison for life, there's zero chance of that happening. \n\nBut in this instance, you're only in prison in life on the third offense.  The offender had two other chances to fix what he did wrong, but he chose to make the same mistakes again.  \n\n&gt;it's not worth $30,000 dollars a year to house and feed someone just because they stole $15 worth of stuff.\n\nI agree, but it's also not worth it to have these people free to continue to commit the same crimes over and over again.  \n\nEdit:  For the record, I agree about your point on schizophrenics.  In those instances, mental health evaluations would do a lot more good than a prison sentence.  ",
            "Btw, the government pays $30-60,000 a year to keep those vicious belt thieves off the streets.  That's your taxes and mine.",
            "That's the part I don't agree with.  $30,000 is a bit much to be spending on a prisoner.  I've never even made $30,000 in a year, so it's absolutely ridiculous that the costs of housing one prisoner is that steep.  They're not worth that much.  They contribute nothing to society.",
            "No, that isn't a normal thing.",
            "It can. There is regular theft that is a misdemeanor if it's under $1,000. Higher than that is grand larceny. Then there is robbery which falls into several categories.\n\nAs to your question though, there are white-collar crimes like embezzlement, fraud, bribery, racketeering, Ponzi schemes, etc. Depending on the seriousness, the judge, and a myriad of other factors, someone can get life sentences or longer for these kinds of crimes. Some countries punish white-collar crime with death sentences as well.",
            "I actually read that there is this guy who stole a jacket worth like $165 and another who stole gasoline and both of them got life imprisonment.",
            "Both true!"

            "I'd say more likely, his videos on topics that are outside of the hard sciences, he is pretty bad/obnoxious. Namely his videos against feminism and the few that he actually goes at the bible, on it's own merits, as well as the videos he attempts to interview/debate. He tends to do far worse at proving his points, say things in ways that provoke more than educate. Even when I agree with his concept, his style and terrible points, make me wish I didn't.\n\nIMO thunderf00t is still one of the best at attacking psudo-science, with actual science, but he often comes into topics he doesn't know as well, with the same confidence as he has in the subjects he is actually good at.

            "&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be “in between,” as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these “transitional forms,” as they are called, should be abundant. \n\nFirstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be \"abundant.\" [Fossilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Fossilization_processes) is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. \n\nSecondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a \"transitional form\" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask \"Where's the transitional form between A and B?\" Futurama summarised this \"debate\" process [rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTOla3TyfqQ)",
            "The others have given good answers, and I would like to add http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis to the mix.\n\nBut over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:\n\n1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.\n\n2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.\n\n3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.\n\n4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.\n\nSo, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...\n\na) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.\n\nb) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.\n\nc) The bible literalists are wrong.\n\nPersonally, I'm leaning towards 'c' as the most likely answer.",
            "&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists’ story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old\n\nThis is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.\n\nYou can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.\n\nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/IIIAchronology.shtml",

            "...\n\nReally?\n\nOK: thought experiment:\n\n&gt;Not all Immigrants.\n\n&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.\n\n&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.\n\n&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.\n\n&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.\n\n&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:\n\n&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.\n\n&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?\n\n&gt;Well, actually…\n\n&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.\n\n&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.\n\n&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.\n\n&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.\n\n&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.\n\n&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.\n\n&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.\n\nI can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.\n\n**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**\n\nAnd it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.\n\nMy very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. \n\nAnd as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the \"oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.\"\n\nChange the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. \n\nSome men.\n\nA minority of men.\n\nA sub-population of men.\n\nCertain kinds of men.\n\nWhatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.\n\nBut not all men. \n\nYou're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. \n\nAnd on a side-note: the \"lived experiences\" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about \"lived experiences\", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.\n\nAlt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.\n\nLived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.\n\nI won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. \n\nThis is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.",

Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC).

All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations. \n\n[Here](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2018/04/ML-2018-Bersani-et-al-Offending-histories-of-undocumented-immigrants.pdf) is the actual, full Migration Letters study that is cited in the news article. From p. 14 Discussion \\(my commentary in brackets\\): \n\nFirst, consistent with previous research, self\\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \\(i.e., first arrest\\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\\-born peers. \\[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \\(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\\] \n\nSecond, compared to their documented immigrant and US\\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\\-years following first arrest. \\[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\\] \n\nThird, and in contrast to the findings for self\\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\\-arrested and are re\\-arrested more in the three\\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \\[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\\] ",

            "You didn't read the caption on the photo. OP is referring to entire existence of humans, not of Mt. Etna. What would it mean entire existence of a mountain anyway? How could one measure the beginning of a mountain? The first grain of sand that built it? There's no plaque \"Established 1908\" on mountains.",

            "It's clear from the snopes article that this meme is paraphrasing a particular claim by a particular author, and it's fully addressed in the article. \n\nIt estimates the yearly output of all volcanoes to be about 550mtons per year, whereas human output about 35,000 mtons per year. That accounts for several hounded active volcanoes.\n\nSo that should give OP enough numbers to do some back of the envelope calculations of he really wanted to answer that question, but I don't think that's what he wanted to know. I think you're giving an over-literal interpretation of his words, without taking into account what he likely meant to say.\n\nAlso even if that is indeed what he meant, it's kinda a silly thing to ask. We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring  trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I. E. if it was highly impactfull, our planet would already be much warmer because volcanos have been around a long time. ",

            "Well what else are you supposed to read when you forget your phone on your way to the shitter?\n\nNo one has to read shampoo instructions by the way, they're only there cause its legally required in some places. If you were trying to say, \"I bet you're the reason they have to put instructions on shampoo bottles\" then your response makes slightly more sense. It is still extremely stupid though, as your choosing a poorly worded, irrelevant, and blatantly nonsensical attempt at an insult over an actual argument for the point you were trying to make.\n\nAltogether, your response has zero relevance with the post or my initial comment so now you just look even more retarded than you did for trying to argue that the picture and the title are not of relation to each other. Let me explain something to you that you seem to not understand. \nThe reason O.P. Is asking the question is because they saw the photo and the numbers sound iffy. It makes no sense that they would have had the question and then found a corresponding photo. The question O.P. asks in the title is meant to be based on what is in the picture; their questions wording doesn't specify that they mean this specific incident but if any sort of common sense is used you can see that they're asking based on a specific incident because thats what is discussed in the photo that leads to the question. I think your confusion is based largely on the last words of the sentence \"in its entire existence\" if you use the photo for context, as that is where the question stems from, its clear that the \"it\" in that sentence is humanity and not the mountain. ",
            "Seems irrelevant, since humanity is currently outputting CO2 [at a much higher **rate** than volcanoes ever did](https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/). We are exceeding the capability of sinks to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (at the same time, we are degrading the environment in ways that decrease the capacity of those sinks: [ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification) and [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation#Atmospheric).)\n\n",
            "Totally false, and ideologically inspired.  We know that, worldwide, volcanoes produce roughly 200M tons of carbon-12 on average (edit: per year).  But we measure 29 *billion* tons of carbon-12 in the atmosphere.  The only \"natural\" source of carbon-12 is.... volcanoes.  Ergo, the rest is unambiguously produced by human activity.\n\nAs touched upon by /u/villianboy, this is basically self evident when you consider the absolutely staggering number of carbon-12 producing \"things\" in the world (factories, cars, etc).  These carbon-12 producers are active 24/7 and have been for decades worldwide.",
            "Eh, well for a volcano to outmatch humanity at this point, it'd have to burn a fuck ton of shit, like a super massive metric fuckton. Planes and boats alone make more CO2 than this, let alone cattle farms, cars, humans, and other odd end things "

            "The title \"Fluoride Officially Classified as a Neurotoxin in World’s Most Prestigious Medical Journal\" is exceptionally silly. Just being published in the lancet doesn't confer any official status on anything; the same journal later published [criticism](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2814%2970119-X/fulltext?hc_location=ufi) of that same paper.",
            "The Lancet is also the journal that published the Wakefield paper.",
            "And apologised/retracted it, to be fair to them. I mean, I doubt you'll find a single medical journal, or perhaps any other sort of major journal, that hasn't published some embarassing guff at one point or another. Which is why of course you can't automatically trust what you read in them; of course, in this case it's more egregious because, I would guess by looking at other articles in the 'natural health' section of that site, they're not normally predisposed to accept something just because it's written in the Lancet, or any other medical journal for that matter.",
            "Yeah. You can't take anything at face value without examining it further, no matter the source.",
            "I've not done any research on this, but my 2 cents:\n\nIn the UK (where I live), there are high-flouride areas in the North (where I happened to grow up), and low-flouride areas in the South.\n\nDentists recognised long ago that there was a regional difference in oral health that exactly matched the natural differences in flouride levels in the local water supplies.\n\nAre we supposed to believe that nobody, at the same time, noticed a corresponding adverse effect?  There would be distinct correlation between having good teeth and dyslexia/adhd.  I find it hard to believe that no one noticed that in the last 40 years.",
            "The dose is the poison. The levels that municipalities fluoridate to have been proven to be safe.  \n\n",
            "[deleted]",
            "By no means an I an expert on this, so please take this reply with a grain of salt.\n\nThe lead in municipal water supplies is not added, it comes from the water pipes themselves.  Most cities main water pipes were constructed 50 - 100+ years ago and contain a large amount of lead.. even homes built before 1986 may contain lead pipes and lead solder.  As the pipes corrode lead enters the water supply.\n\nThe biggest difference between ingesting lead and fluoride is fluoride is water soluble lead is not.  So your body will get rid of fluoride (like it does with most things you ingest), lead on the other hand is a heavy metal and your body has no way of dealing with it.  Over time, the lead builds up in our system causing toxicity  This is known as bioaccumulation.\n ",
            "Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.\n\nThe website refers to this study: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: \"A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable.\" \n\nIf you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621182/):\"Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.\"\n\nSo the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.\n\nTL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect.  Debunked.",
            "Best response. As someone with ADHD I was pretty interested in this one. Thanks!!",
            "For starters, lets look at the definition of neurotoxin:\n\n&gt;Neurotoxins are substances that are poisonous or destructive to nerve tissue. Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue.\n\nTo say that fluoride is a a neurotoxin, but it *only* causes ADHD and dyslexia is suspect as fuck.\n\nThe title itself gives away the likely falsity of the article. Citing chemical name to induce fear? Check.  Referencing poorly understood psychological disorders? Check.  Mentioning pandemic and children in the same sentence? Double whammy.",
            "One thing \"scare articles\" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. \n\nThe whole thing came about as a result of a condition called \"texas teeth\".  Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay.  The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water.  Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked.  So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it.  Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.\n\nI'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride.  At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water.  However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.\n\nMy mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available.  My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager.  My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it.  Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios.  My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school \"treatment\" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes.  I may be a bit nerdy but I don't think I've suffered neurological trauma from it."

Most of the time people think they are consuming iodine salt, they are actually just consuming salt, and the iodine is mostly gone. Buy salt regularly or keep it in a sealed container.",

            "Well the article is wrong because if you go to any grocery store near you, check out literally 90% of the brands that sell salt. They will have somewhere on the label that says, \"does not contain iodide, a necessary nutrient.\" Almost every form of table salt in any restaurant and the most popular brand, Morton's does not contain iodide. This is as easily verifiable as going to the store. My parents have 4 different types of salt in their house, my grandparents have 3 different types and not one of them contain iodide. I was surprised this was the case because that's literally the whole point of salt, to supply iodide. \n\nI use (actual) Himalayan pink salt, and Mediterranean sea salt. Both contain not only iodide but a bunch of other naturally-occurring minerals as well. I also take one drop of sublingual iodine every morning which helps the functions of your thyroid gland. Thyroid is one of the glands located at the throat chakra and in the last 6-8 months I've taken it, I've noticed a drastic increase in my ability to communicate my ideas. I always used to have a problem with this as an adult up until recently. \n\nIt's definitely a crisis. At least in the US.",

Iodized Morton's has a big yellow \"Iodized\" label across the front of it. \n\nIodide has to be added to salt. So if you're getting some whole foods hippie-ass sea salt they might not have added iodide to be more \"natural.\"",
            "I pick iodized salt. I do not buy it if it doesn't. I agree that it is a choice at the store but what I'm saying is look at the number of salt brands finding iodide versus not. The majority is non-iodized. Go check for yourself. ",

            "We evolved as omnivores, but I do agree with you that people don't run great on bad diets.  I don't think it's just malnutrition that is the culprit because the more I learn about gut flora the more I think that maybe some of the stuff in our diet is feeding the wrong bacteria inside of us.",

You can simply look at our body's digestive system and it's self-evident, just as you can look at a cow's digestive system and tell it's designed to eat grass rather than meat. Perhaps we really did live for 600+ years until people started straying from that natural diet as omnivores and thereby damaging their bodies.\n\nProbiotics are helpful for cultivating a healthy (for you) gut flora, but make sure you're cultivating the *right* bacteria. Sourcrout, for example, contains plant-eating bacteria whereas kambucha contains sugar-eating bacteria. Dunno about you, but I don't need encouragement to eat sugar.",
            "The sugars most people get in their diet is terrible, not just the kinds but the amounts.  I think even recently studies were suggesting that c.diff was being made worse through an alternative to sucrose.  I really doubt the 600+ years thing because we were also prone to infections, parasites, etc...  There might be, or was at one time, humans with the right genetics to live that long but I don't really think so.\n\nAs for probiotics, you definitely need to do a little bit of homework to avoid wasting your money.  Just like various supplements, the claims made by the companies making them can be misleading.",

There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds,  etc are NOT DHA.\n\nMany people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently.
